    This service provides covers for library materials indexed by isbn, issn, faust, pid.
    The service is provided by [Danskernes Digitale Bibliotek](https://www.danskernesdigitalebibliotek.dk/)

    ### Authentication notes

    Authentication is done via OAuth2 against auth.dbc.dk. To obtain a valid token follow instructions in
    [1.2. Password Grant](https://github.com/DBCDK/hejmdal/blob/oAuth2/src/oAuth2/README.md#12-password-grant).
    To use the "Authorize" option in this tool use your 'client_id' and 'client_secret' and fill in '@' for
    both username and password.

    ### Implementation notes

    Currently the API is not fully implemented. The following features are missing:

    * Generic Covers: parameter is currently ignored. Service doesn't yet provide generic covers.

    * Image sizes: parameter is currently ignored. All available sizes are returned.

    * Pagination: not implemented.

    * Oauth: not implemented.
